Nexus Library â€“ A Smart and Secure Digital Library Management System

Project Overview
The Nexus Library System is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project designed to create a scalable, efficient, and secure digital library management system using Java. It addresses critical issues from a recent system upgrade, such as duplicate records, unauthorized access, and unoptimized search algorithms. The system leverages OOP principles and design patterns to manage library items (e.g., e-books, printed books), user roles (e.g., students, faculty), and features like real-time tracking, role-based access, and smart recommendations. An optional JavaFX-based graphical dashboard enhances usability for librarians.

This project is developed as part of a group assignment, adhering to strict OOP and design pattern guidelines, with a focus on modularity, maintainability, and team collaboration.

Problem Statement
The Nexus Library System aims to fix:

1. Duplicate/Missing Records: Confusing book availability.
2. Unauthorized Access: Copyright violations in restricted collections.
3. Incorrect Status: Books marked as borrowed when available.
4. Poor Search/Recommendations: Frustrating user experience.

Our goal is to redesign the system to ensure reliability, security, and efficiency for modern library needs.
